          London's Air Ambulance Charity has been at the forefront of innovation
          in pre-hospital emergency medical care since its inception in 1989.
          The service has adopted elements of medical, military and aviation
          culture to deliver the highest standards in intensive care to the
          roadside. The governance system and standard operating procedures
          (SOP) developed by the organisation are seen as a benchmark for other
          air ambulances across the world. London's Air Ambulance carries a
          senior doctor in addition to a paramedic at all times, providing a
          24/7 advanced trauma care outside of hospital, provide general
          anaesthetics on scene, and carry blood on board and administer blood
          transfusion on the roadside. From 2018, a consultant in pre-hospital
          emergency medicine will be present on most shifts, in addition to the
          other physician and paramedic. In 2014, London's Air Ambulance
          performed the first pre-hospital resuscitative endovascular balloon
          occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). Other key treatments performed by the
          service include surgical chest draining (thoracostomy), surgical and
          non-surgical rapid sequence induction (RSI), pelvic splinting (crucial
          to prevent blood loss in high impact crashes and crush injuries),
          advanced pain relief and sedation. The service started a trial of a
          portable brain scanner which can detect blood clots on the brain in
          April 2015.
